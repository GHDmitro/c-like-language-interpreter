C-Like Language Interpreter

This program is a result of a series of projects that I had to do for the Programming Languages class taught by Professor Mohaammad Irfan in the Fall of 2014.

-------

Interpreter is implemented in Java and serves as a translator for C-Like languages based on the grammar defined in Allen Tucker's book "Programming Languages".

In case you will want to run this program, please compile it using NetBeans.
